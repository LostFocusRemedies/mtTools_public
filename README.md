A collection of Maya tools and utilities created by Lost Focus Remedies.  
That's a bit of a showcase of what I can do. 

## Available Tools

### Keyframe Randomizer
A tool to add controlled randomness to animation keyframes for more organic motion. Useful for adding shakes, or organic animation to your characters. 

### Animation to Path
A tool to convert keyframe animation to a curve path. Useful in situation where you have charcaters or vehicles moving or flying, and it's quick to do keyframe blocking, but you want to have finer control over the trajectory. 

### Renamer

Especially useful when assigned to F2 shortcut, similar to OS behaviour. 

### Snap to Ground
A Tool to snap selected object(s) to a ground underneath. 

### Camera Label Creator
A Tool to create text attached to camera every x frames. It's useful in early production, when populating library of poses for characters, and keep everything neat. 

### Reset Attribute
An animation to reset rig control attributes to their default value.

### IKFK Fast
A polite IKFK snapper, that's designed to be easy to configure, and performant.

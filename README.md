A collection of Maya tools and utilities created by Lost Focus Remedies.  
That's a bit of a showcase of what I can do. 

## Available Tools

### Keyframe Randomizer
A tool to add controlled randomness to animation keyframes for more organic motion. Useful for adding shakes, or organic animation to your characters. 

### Animation to Path
A tool to convert keyframe animation to a curve path. Useful in situation where you have charcaters or vehicles moving or flying, and it's quick to do keyframe blocking, but you want to have finer control over the trajectory. 

### Renamer
A small tool to help you rename multiple objects, handling padding numbering aswell. 
Especially useful when assigned to F2 shortcut, similar to OS behaviour. 

## Installation

Each tool can be installed independently. See the README in each tool's directory for specific installation instructions.
